## Compatibility

This add-on is developed and tested with:
- OpenNebula 5.8+

## Requirements

Python module `pyone`

## How to use

First of all, navigate to your ansible project directory and clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/FELDSAM-INC/ansible-one-inv.git
```

Install dependencies and configure.

```bash
cd ansible-one-inv
pip install pyone
cp config.sample.py config.py
nano config.py # configure
cd -
```

Sample config:
```
# OpenNebula XML-RPC API connection details
ONE = {
    'address': 'https://opennebula:2633/RPC2',
    'username': 'user',
    'password': 'pass'
}

# Whether to use VM name or IP (first one found) as hostname
USE_VM_NAME = False

# VM USER_TEMPLATE var to use as hostname
# Fallback:
# 1. check USE_VM_NAME and if True return use VM name
# 2. use VM IP (first one found)
HOSTNAME_USER_TEMPLATE_VAR = ''

# Skip VMs by labels
SKIP_LABELS = [
    'SomeLabel'
]
```

Test

```
./ansible-one-inv/one-inv --list
```

Configure ansible inventory

```bash
nano ansible.cfg

...
inventory = ./ansible-one-inv/one-inv
...
```

Now you can use dynamic inventory in your playbooks. Hosts will be grouped by OpenNebula Labels to Ansible Host Groups.

## Notes

### Host groups

This script defines host groups by labels assigned to VMs in OpenNebula.  
There is one special group `All`, which contains all VMs.  
One VM can be in more groups if have more labels.

### Custom SSH ports

There is support to define custom ssh port in VM USER_TEMPLATE.  
Just add variable `SSH_PORT` and Ansible use it.
